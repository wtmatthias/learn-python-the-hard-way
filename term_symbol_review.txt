## Review of Terms

`end=' '`
- put in print statement at the end of `print()` line to add a space between strings in `print()`. e.g.:

      print(word1 + word2 + word3, end=' ')
      print(word4 + word5)

- the comma *must* proceed 'word3' if you want the printed string on the same line when printed


`{}`
- allows you to call a variable within a string (i.e. `print()` function)
- this type of string is called a *format string*


`\n`
- when printed w/ a string it tells Python to stop parsing on one line and to continue/restart parsing the string on the next line
